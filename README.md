## Summary
Simulating cyberattacks and endpoint detection and response (EDR) using:
1) An Ubuntu attack server
2) The Sliver framework for generating malicious command and control (C2) payloads
3) A vulnerable Windows endpoint for executing the malicious payloads
4) The LimaCharlie SecOps Cloud Platform for conducting EDR for the Windows VM
